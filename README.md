# PHScalibration
Code accompanying the article "Data-driven adjoint-based calibration of port-Hamiltonian systems in time domain" by Michael GÃ¼nther, Birgit Jacob and Claudia Totzeck (University of Wuppertal)

To generate the data and plots of the first test case. Run > python test_manifold_deterministic.py
For data and plots of the second test case. Run > python test_manifold_stochastic.py
For the restuls simple mass-spring-damper chain. Run > python test_manifold_MSD.py

We ran the code examples on a MacBookAir (M1, 2020) with python 3.7.13 installed via Anaconda.
